# 🐢 Turtle Graphics Pack  

A creative collection of figures drawn entirely with Python’s built-in [`turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) module.  
This project demonstrates how procedural graphics, fractals, and custom shapes can be generated with simple Python code — no external libraries required.  

The pack is split into two parts:  

---

## Part 1 — Shaded Front Faces  

Introductory geometric figures with basic fills, contours, and line styles.  

**Figures included:**  
1. ♦️ **Double rhombuses** — white fill, black contour only  
2. 🔺 **Triangle with inset** — filled inner triangle  
3. 📐 **Isometric prism** — shaded front face, dashed back edges  
4. ⭕ **Olympic rings** — monochrome outline  
5. 🧭 **Compass rose** — centered circle; cardinal labels in light purple  
6. ◼️ **Marked square** — dashed edges, diagonals, and dots  

**Preview:**

## Part 2 — Extended Figures  

More advanced figures, showing fractals, natural forms, and composite shapes.  

**Figures included:**  
1. 🌞 **Sun** — yellow disk with alternating rays  
2. 🌀 **Logarithmic spiral** — mathematical spiral with thicker line  
3. 🐝 **Honeycomb + Bee** — gold hexagonal grid with a simple bee built from shapes  
4. ❄️ **Koch snowflake** — fractal, filled white with purple outline  
5. 🌸 **Flower** — arc-petal flower (petals only, no center circle)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes  

Through this project I practiced and demonstrated:  
- Procedural drawing with Python’s `turtle`  
- Use of modular functions for reusability  
- Shading with `begin_fill()` and `end_fill()`  
- Drawing mathematical shapes (spirals, fractals, honeycomb tiling)  
- Combining primitives into composite figures (e.g., the bee with body, wings, stripes, stinger)  
- Visual design and layout for clear composition
